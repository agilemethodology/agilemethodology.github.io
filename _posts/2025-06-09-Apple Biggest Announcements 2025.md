# WWDC 2025: Everything You Need to Know About Apple's Biggest Announcements (Live Updates)

**Breaking:** Apple's WWDC 2025 is happening RIGHT NOW, and we're witnessing what might be the most dramatic iPhone redesign since iOS 7. If you've been wondering whether to upgrade this fall, these announcements will help you decide.

*Last updated: June 9, 2025, 2:30 PM PT*

## The Big Surprise: It's iOS 26, Not iOS 19

Here's something nobody saw coming: Apple is changing the naming for its operating system updates – the "26" represents the September 2025 to September 2026 release season. That's right – we're getting **iOS 26** instead of the expected iOS 19.

This isn't just a number change. It signals Apple's commitment to delivering more substantial yearly updates that deserve their own year-based identity. Think about it: when someone asks "what iOS are you running?" in 2026, you'll say "iOS 26" and immediately know it's current.

## The "Liquid Glass" Revolution: Your iPhone is About to Look Completely Different

Remember when iOS 7 made everything flat and colorful? Well, **WWDC 2025** is bringing another visual revolution that's equally dramatic. Apple is about to introduce a pretty major change to the look and feel of its interface, and it looks like it's going to be called Liquid Glass.

### What Exactly is Liquid Glass?

Liquid Glass will "include transparency and shine effects in all of Apple's tool bars, in-app interfaces and controls." Think of it like looking through frosted glass – everything becomes more transparent, reflective, and visually striking.

Here's what you'll actually see on your phone:
- **Toolbars that you can see through** (imagine Safari's address bar with a glass-like transparency)
- **App interfaces with subtle shine effects** that make everything feel more premium
- **Control Center icons that look nearly round** instead of the current squared design
- **Home screen icons with glass-like depth** that catch light differently

Over 1,000 TechRadar readers responded to a poll to say that they were most looking forward to the visionOS-style redesign that's been predicted for the iPhone. Turns out, they were right to be excited.

## Messages App Gets Its Biggest Update Ever

Your group chats are about to get way more interesting. **Apple WWDC** revealed two major Messages upgrades:

**1. Polls in Group Messages**
Finally! Apple is planning to announce the ability to create polls in the Messages app on iOS 26. No more "where should we eat?" followed by 20 individual responses. Just create a poll, everyone votes, decision made.

**2. Custom Chat Backgrounds**
The option to set a background image within a conversation is coming to Messages. Think WhatsApp-style custom backgrounds, but with Apple's signature polish.

## Why This Apple Event Matters More Than Usual

Most **Apple WWDC** events focus on incremental improvements. This year is different. We're seeing:

1. **The biggest visual overhaul since 2013** with Liquid Glass design
2. **A complete numbering system change** that affects all operating systems
3. **Major AI improvements** that finally put Apple back in the conversation
4. **iPad finally becoming laptop-like** with proper desktop features

## The iPad Finally Grows Up: iPadOS 26 Changes Everything

If you've been waiting for your iPad to replace your laptop, **WWDC 2025** might have delivered what you need. The rumored changes include:

- **Mac-style menu bar** at the top of the screen
- **Proper windowing system** that doesn't make you want to throw your iPad
- **Stage Manager that actually works** the way it should have from day one
- **Desktop-class multitasking** that professionals have been begging for

## macOS 26 "Tahoe": The Desktop Gets the Glass Treatment Too

Your Mac isn't being left out. **Apple WWDC 2025** brought macOS 26 (codenamed "Tahoe") with:

- The same Liquid Glass aesthetic as iOS 26
- Better iPhone and iPad integration (your devices finally talk to each other properly)
- AI-powered features that actually help with real work
- Performance improvements that make older Macs feel new again

## Apple Intelligence: The AI Comeback Story

Let's be honest – Apple was getting left behind in AI while everyone else was launching ChatGPT competitors. **WWDC 2025** is Apple's answer to that criticism.

The company is demonstrating that they've been working on AI integration that actually makes sense for regular people, not just tech enthusiasts. Instead of a separate AI app, Apple Intelligence is woven throughout iOS 26, making your phone smarter without making it complicated.

## When Can You Actually Use This Stuff?

Here's the timeline that matters to you:

- **Today:** Developers get beta access (if you're not a developer, don't worry about this)
- **July 2025:** Public beta releases (you can try it, but expect bugs)
- **September 2025:** Official release for everyone

**Pro tip:** Wait for the official release unless you love living dangerously with buggy software.

## Should You Upgrade This Fall?

Based on what we're seeing at **Apple WWDC 2025**, this looks like a "must-upgrade" year if:

- You care about how your phone looks (the Liquid Glass design is stunning)
- You use group messages frequently (polls will change your life)
- You want your iPad to actually replace your laptop
- You're tired of feeling like your Apple devices don't work together seamlessly

## The Bottom Line: Apple is Back

**WWDC 2025** feels like Apple remembering what made them special in the first place: taking existing technology and making it so much better that you can't imagine going back.

The **iOS 26** redesign isn't just about looking pretty (though it does). It's about creating interfaces that feel more natural, more responsive, and more alive. When you combine that with actual useful AI features and cross-device integration that finally works, you get an ecosystem that justifies the premium price.

## What Happens Next?

We'll be updating this post throughout **Apple WWDC 2025** as more details emerge. The keynote is just the beginning – the real story unfolds over the next week as developers dive into the new features and find hidden gems Apple didn't have time to mention.
