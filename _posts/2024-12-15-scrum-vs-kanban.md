When choosing an Agile framework, Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely adopted methodologies. But how do you decide which one is the best fit for your team? Let's break down the differences:

### **Scrum: Structured and Iterative**
Scrum works in fixed-length iterations known as sprints (typically 2-4 weeks). During each sprint, a set of tasks is completed, and the team holds regular meetings like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. Scrum is ideal for teams that work on projects with defined milestones and a clear product backlog.

#### Key Features:
- Time-boxed sprints
- Defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)
- Focus on delivering a complete set of features at the end of each sprint

### **Kanban: Continuous and Flexible**
Kanban is a flow-based system that focuses on continuous delivery without the time-boxed constraints of Scrum. It uses a visual board to track the progress of tasks as they move through various stages. Kanban is perfect for teams working on ongoing tasks or maintenance work with no strict deadlines.

#### Key Features:
- Continuous flow of work
- No fixed iterations
- Work in Progress (WIP) limits to avoid bottlenecks

### **Which One Should You Choose?**
- **Use Scrum** if you need a structured framework with defined roles and regular review points.
- **Use Kanban** if you prefer flexibility and have a continuous flow of tasks or support-focused work.

Choosing the right methodology depends on your team’s specific needs, so evaluate the nature of your projects before making a decision.
